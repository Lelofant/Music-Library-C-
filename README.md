# MusicLibrary - Console Application for managing a Music Library

## After completing and submitting the SoftUni C# Advanced exam, I decided to take the project further by turning it into an interactive console app. 
This way, users can input all the necessary data themselves, while I kept all the core features intact.

## This project is a simple C# console application for managing a music library. 
The user can add songs, search and filter them, remove songs, and generate a report of the library's contents.

## Main Features:
- Add songs
- Remove songs by title and artist
- Find the longest song
- View details of a specific song
- Count all songs in the library
- Filter songs by genre
- Generate a detailed report of the library
- Save the library to a file using JSON serialization
